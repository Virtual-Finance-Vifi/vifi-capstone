vCurrency Genesis:

There needs to be a vCurrency proposal which has the ticker symbol name and orcale address

when the owner of the VARQ approves the proposal

 it allows users to stake vUSD and indicate an opening pair ratio

once a threshold of 10M vUSD is hit

the owner can then begin the vCurrency Gensis.

a weighted average of vusd staked and pair ratio would determine the final opening ratio

all the vUSD is then converted into a vCurrency pair and added as liquidity into a AMM unsiwap v2 pool

the LP is locked for 30 days.

the LP accures yield from the underlaying callateral and LP can claim vUSD on withdrawal.

there is a vCurrency termination whereby

if the Liquity reserves in either vRQT or vFiat falls below 10% of the supply, swaps are closed

vRQT to vFiat raio is compared aginst all the vUSD burned to create it (S_u)

this then prices in a single token claim to vUSD

so vFiat can be claimed for vUSD at the protocol rate

and vRQT can be claimed at the last raio of the uniswap pool

effectively allow no new vCurrency mints, but direct claims to vUSD
